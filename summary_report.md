# Summary of Work Done Today (June 17, 2025)

## Overview
Today's work focused on two main areas:
1. Major project restructuring to improve code organization
2. Implementation of a new greedy AI algorithm for multi-agent path finding (MAPF)

## Project Restructuring (3 hours ago)
A significant refactoring of the project structure was completed to improve code organization and maintainability:

- Reorganized source files into logical modules:
  - Created `mapflib` module for core data structures and definitions
  - Created `multiapf` module for AI implementations and execution loops
- Moved files from root directory to appropriate modules:
  - `src/mapf.rs` → `src/multiapf/mapf.rs`
  - `src/sparse.rs` → `src/mapflib/sparse.rs`
  - `src/ais.rs` → `src/multiapf/ais.rs`
  - `src/loops.rs` → `src/multiapf/loops.rs`
- Removed unused files:
  - `src/timing.rs`
  - `src/state_definition.rs`
- Updated dependencies in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`

This restructuring provides a cleaner separation of concerns and better organization of the codebase.

## Greedy AI Implementation (3 minutes ago)
Implemented a new greedy AI algorithm for multi-agent path finding:

### Core AI Implementation
- Created a new `GreedyAI` class in `src/multiapf/ais.rs`
- Renamed the existing `RandomMCTSAI` to `RandomAI` for clarity
- Implemented a distance-based pathfinding approach:
  - Uses breadth-first search to calculate distances from all positions to goals
  - Selects moves that minimize the distance to the goal
  - Caches the distance grid for efficiency

### Supporting Changes
- Fixed a bug in the player index calculation in the evaluation loop
- Added verbose logging options to aid in debugging
- Updated test maps to support testing the new AI
- Added a unit test to verify the greedy AI's functionality

### Main Application Updates
- Modified `main.rs` to use the new greedy AI
- Set up a test scenario with one greedy AI and one random AI
- Enabled verbose output for detailed logging
- Changed the default map to "defender.txt"

## Testing
- Created and updated test maps to validate the greedy AI
- Added a unit test that verifies the greedy AI makes the expected move in a test scenario
- Manual testing was performed with the updated main application

## Conclusion
Today's work has significantly improved the project's structure and added a more sophisticated AI algorithm. The greedy AI provides a more intelligent pathfinding approach compared to the previous random selection method, which should lead to better performance in multi-agent path finding scenarios.
