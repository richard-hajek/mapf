# MAPF Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a list of actionable improvement tasks for the MAPF (Multi-Agent Path Finding) project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Code Organization and Architecture

1. [ ] Refactor the coordinate system in mapf.rs to use more intuitive naming (row/col instead of a0/a1)
2. [ ] Extract the hardcoded environment definition in MAPFEnvironment::new() to a configuration file or parameter
3. [ ] Create separate modules for different components (e.g., environment, state, actions)
4. [ ] Implement proper error handling with Result types instead of panics
5. [ ] Add configuration options for simulation parameters (currently hardcoded in main.rs)
6. [ ] Implement a proper logging system instead of println! statements
7. [ ] Create a visualization module for better representation of the MAPF environment

## Incomplete Implementations

8. [ ] Implement the Debug trait for MAPFState (currently marked with todo!())
9. [ ] Implement the is_finished method in MAPFEnvironment (currently marked with todo!())
10. [ ] Implement the get_heuristic method in MAPFEnvironment (currently marked with todo!())
11. [ ] Fix the rng() usage in main.rs (likely should be rand::thread_rng())
12. [ ] Add proper termination conditions for the simulation

## Error Handling

13. [ ] Replace panic-inducing expect() calls with proper error handling
14. [ ] Add bounds checking for matrix operations with meaningful error messages
15. [ ] Implement error propagation throughout the codebase
16. [ ] Add validation for input parameters in public functions
17. [ ] Create custom error types for different error scenarios

## Documentation

18. [ ] Add crate-level documentation explaining the project's purpose
19. [ ] Document the StateEnvironment trait with examples
20. [ ] Add comprehensive documentation to the SparseMatrix2D implementation
21. [ ] Document the MAPF algorithm and its implementation
22. [ ] Add usage examples to README.md
23. [ ] Document the coordinate system and matrix indexing conventions
24. [ ] Add inline comments explaining complex logic in the codebase

## Testing

25. [ ] Set up a testing framework
26. [ ] Write unit tests for SparseMatrix2D operations
27. [ ] Write unit tests for MAPFState and MAPFAction
28. [ ] Write integration tests for the MAPF environment
29. [ ] Add property-based tests for matrix operations
30. [ ] Implement test coverage reporting
31. [ ] Create benchmarks for performance-critical operations

## Performance Optimizations

32. [ ] Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks
33. [ ] Optimize the sparse matrix implementation for common operations
34. [ ] Consider using more efficient data structures for specific use cases
35. [ ] Implement parallel processing for independent operations
36. [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data

47. [ ] Add support for different heuristics
48. [ ] Implement conflict detection and resolution
49. [ ] Add support for dynamic obstacles
