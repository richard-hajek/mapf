# Import Structure Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the import structure in the MAPF project. The goal was to make the imports more consistent, organized, and maintainable.

## Changes Made

### 1. Consistent Use of `crate::` Prefix
- All imports now use the `crate::` prefix consistently, which makes it clear that the imported items are from within the same crate.
- Example: Changed `use multiapf::ais::RandomAI;` to `use crate::multiapf::ais::RandomAI;` in main.rs.

### 2. Grouped Related Imports
- Related imports are now grouped together, which makes it easier to understand the dependencies of each file.
- Example: Grouped all imports from `crate::multiapf::ais` together in main.rs.

### 3. Used Nested Paths
- Used nested paths for imports from the same module, which reduces repetition and makes the code more concise.
- Example: Changed multiple imports from std to a single nested import in mapf.rs:
  ```rust
  use std::{
      error::Error,
      fmt::{self, Debug, Formatter},
      fs,
      hash::{Hash, Hasher},
      path::Path,
      sync::Arc,
  };
  ```

### 4. Organized Import Order
- Imports are now organized in a logical order: first crate imports, then external crates, then std imports.
- This makes it easier to find specific imports and understand the dependencies of each file.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: The consistent use of `crate::` prefix and grouped imports makes the code easier to read and understand.

2. **Reduced Duplication**: Using nested paths reduces duplication in import statements, making the code more concise.

3. **Better Maintainability**: Organized imports make it easier to add, remove, or modify dependencies in the future.

4. **Follows Rust Best Practices**: The changes align with Rust's recommended practices for organizing imports.

## Testing
All tests were run after making these changes, and they all passed successfully, confirming that the changes don't break any functionality.
